# WebSocket vs. aiohttp Comparison Repository

This repository is created to compare the performance of websockets and aiohttp. Through various tests including latency, throughput, and scalability measurements, as well as CPU and memory evaluations, we aim to provide comprehensive insights into the performance characteristics of these technologies.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and compare the performance of websockets and aiohttp, two popular asynchronous Python libraries used for building web applications with WebSocket support. By conducting rigorous tests and evaluations, we seek to identify the strengths, weaknesses, and optimal use cases for each library.
